## Lessons Learned

- **React Fundamentals:** Deepened understanding of React, enhancing my ability to write and optimize React code.
- **Component Interaction:** Mastered the use of React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **API Integration:** Gained experience in fetching and handling data through APIs.
- **UI Components:** Developed skills in implementing Material-UI components for a consistent and responsive interface.
- **Animations:** Implemented motion components from Framer Motion in the hero section for dynamic user interactions.
- **Data Handling:** Learned to effectively render dynamic data using JavaScriptâ€™s `map` function.

## Project Challenges and Solutions

### Data Parsing
- **Improved Understanding of API Responses:** Utilized a JSON formatter to enhance the mapping and utilization of the fetched data, making the integration process smoother and more effective.

### API Rate Limit Management
- **Optimizing API Calls:** Solved rate limit issues by conditionally triggering API calls only when necessary (on state changes), which improved both the performance and efficiency of the application.

### Layout Responsiveness
- **Responsive Design Challenges:** Addressed responsiveness issues across various devices by employing CSS media breakpoints, ensuring a consistent and adaptive user experience.

### Horizontal Scrollbar Responsiveness
- **Scrollbar Adaptability:** Tackled challenges with the horizontal scrollbar's responsiveness by applying a trial and error approach with CSS adjustments, achieving optimal functionality on different screens.
